title: Free Monoids and Free Monads, Free of Category Theory

Free monoids and free monads are important concepts to understand in functional programming. A free monoid on type `A` is just `List[A]`. List is the single most widely used data structure in functional programming and everyone knows what a list is. But not everyone knows why lists are called free monoids, and what is so "free" about it. And it pays to do so, because understanding what free monoids are about will make the concept of free monads much more comprehensible.


In this post I'd like to explain what free monoids and free monads are to functional programming beginners. I'll try to explain them in a "free of category theory" way to make it easier for those who are not well-versed in category theory (although it won't be 100% free). As a result, the explanation will be less formal or precise as it could be, and will be mainly based on intuition and examples. If you want to learn the rigorous definitions, a category theory book could be your best bet.

Basic knowledge of monoids, functors and monads required to follow this post.


# Free Monoids

## Intuition

"Free" in free monoids and free monads is generally taken to mean "structure free", although I'd like to think of it as "free of unnecessary information loss". In other words, a "free something" should be the "something" that preserves the most information, or the most general "something", among all "something"s.

A monoid is a set with a binary operator (often referred to as the `combine` operator) and a unit element, satisfying certain laws. The set associated with monoid is called its underlying set. For example, `(Int, +, 0)` is a monoid, as is `(Int, ×, 1)` (the "Int" here represents all integers, rather than the Int type in Scala which is a finite set). The underlying set of both monoids is Int. When we talk about the most general monoid, we need to specify a particular set, as in the most general monoid for Int, the most general monoid for Boolean, etc.

Let's focus on Int here. What is the most general monoid for integers? It turns out to be `(List[Int], ++, Nil)` where `++` concatenates two lists. Why? Because it is free of unnecessary information loss, where "unnecessary information loss" here means "unnecessary collapsing of lists". We can collapse the lists in `(List[Int], ++, Nil)` in different ways to obtain different monoids. For example, if we add up all numbers in each list in `(List[Int], ++, Nil)`, we get `(Int, +, 0)`; if we multiply all numbers in each list, we get `(Int, ×, 1)`. By contrast, `(Int, +, 0)` cannot be the most general monoid for Int, because once you collapse 2 + 3 + 5 to 10, the original elements, namely 2, 3 and 5, are gone.

Note that `(List[Int], ++, Nil)` _does_ lose certain information, but that is necessary for satisfying monoid laws. For example, given `List(2, 3, 5)`, you don't know whether it is obtained from `List(2, 3) ++ List(5)` or `List(2) ++ List(3, 5)`. That information is lost in the concatenation. In other words, both `((2, 3), 5)` and `(2, (3, 5))` are collapsed into `(2, 3, 5)`. This information loss is _necessary_, because monoid law requires that the `combine` operator of the monoid be associative, so it must give the same result whether you first combine 2 with 3, or first combine 3 with 5.

So, this is basically the intuition of what a free monoid is, and why lists are free monoids. In summary, a free monoid is a monoid for a particular set `A` whose binary operator does not collapse elements unnecessarily (except as required by law), and `List[A]` satisfies this requirement perfectly. This is, of course, an extremely informal and imprecise description. Next let's see a slightly more rigorous way of explaining free monoid, also known as universal construction in category theory.


## Universal Construction

A free monoid for Int, denoted as `FreeMonoid`<sub>`Int`</sub>, is a monoid such that, given any other monoid `(A, ⊗, e)` and any function `f` of type `Int => A`, `f` uniquely identifies a [monoid homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Monoid_homomorphisms) from `FreeMonoid`<sub>`Int`</sub> to `(A, ⊗, e)`, and vice versa. In other words, given any other monoid `(A, ⊗, e)`, there is a 1-1 mapping between functions of type `Int => A` and monoid homomorphisms from `FreeMonoid`<sub>`Int`</sub> to `(A, ⊗, e)`.

Here are some examples, assuming `FreeMonoid`<sub>`Int`</sub> is `List[Int]`:

__Example 1.__ If `(A, ⊗, e) = (Int, +, 0)` and `f = identity`, then the monoid homomorphism identified by `f` maps every list of integers to their sum, and maps the empty list to 0.

__Example 2.__ If `(A, ⊗, e) = (Int, ×, 1)` and `f = identity`, then the monoid homomorphism identified by `f` maps every list of integers to their product, and maps the empty list to 1.


__Example 3.__ If `(A, ⊗, e) = (Int, +, 0)` and `f` is the following function, which maps every integer to either 1, 2 or 3:

```scala
def f (x: Int): Int = {
  if (x == 1) 1
  else if (x == 2) 2
  else 3
}
```

Then the monoid homomorphism identified by `f` maps every list of integers `List(x1, x2, ..., xk)` to `f(x1) + f(x2) + ... + f(xk)`, and maps the empty list to 0.


__Example 4.__ If `(A, ⊗, e) = ({1, 2, 3}, 〽, 1)` where `〽` is defined as:
 - `1 〽 x = x 〽 1 = x` for `x = 1, 2, 3`
 - `x 〽 y = x` for `x = 2, 3; y = 2, 3`

And `f` is the same function as above, then the monoid homomorphism identified by `f` maps every list of integers `List(x1, x2, ..., xk)` to `f(x1) 〽 f(x2) 〽 ... 〽 f(xk)`, and maps the empty list to 1.


As we can see, it doesn't matter what `(A, ⊗, e)` is or what `f` is. Given any `(A, ⊗, e)` and any `f: Int => A`, `f` always uniquely identifies a monoid homomorphism. Given any list of integers `List(x1, x2, ..., xk)`, this monoid homomorphism maps the list to `f(x1) ⊗ f(x2) ⊗ ... ⊗ f(xk)`, or `e` for the empty list. It is easy to verify that this is indeed a monoid homomorphism. This is only possible if the binary operator of `FreeMonoid`<sub>`Int`</sub> is free of unnecessary collapsing of elements, so that we can interpret each list of elements however we want at a later time, where "at a later time" means "after given the function `f`".

It is easy to see that, by contrast, `(Int, +, 0)` cannot possibly be the free monoid for Int, as the `+` operator loses a lot of information. There are obviously much fewer monoid homomorphisms from `(Int, +, 0)` to `(Int, ×, 1)` than there are functions of type `Int => Int`. The vast majority of such functions, including the identity function, are not monoid homomorphisms from `(Int, +, 0)` to `(Int, ×, 1)`. In fact, only a few special functions of type `Int => Int` are monoid homomorphisms, such as the function that maps all integers to 1.


# Free Monads

## Analogy to Free Monoids

Understanding free monoids makes free monads much easier to comprehend, as they are conceptually very similar. After all, a monad _is_ a monoid, in the category of endofunctors. A regular monoid, such as `(Int, +, 0)`, is a monoid in the category of sets. So they are both monoids in some monoidal category.

In functional programming, an endofunctor is just a functor, i.e., a type constructor that can map; a set is just a type. So, the main difference between free monoids and free monads is that free monoids are defined on top of types while free monads are defined on top of functors. In other words, a monoid has an underlying set, while a monad as an underlying functor.

Indeed, the `join` method of a monad is similar as the `combine` operator of a monoid:
 - `combine` takes two values in the underlying set, and turn them into another value in the underlying set. Its type is `(A, A) => A`.
 - `join` takes two applications of the underlying functor, and turn them into a single application of the underlying functor: `F[F[_]] => F[_]`.

Since a free monoid is a monoid that avoids unnecessary collapsing of elements in `combine`, we can make the analogy and say that a free monad is a monad that avoids unnecessary collapsing of functors in `join`, i.e., it records both original functor applications rather than collapsing them into a single functor application.

We now know that a free monoid is a list, so you may guess that a free monad is some structure similar as a list. Indeed, list allows concatenation, rather than collapsing, which is what we want for free monoid and free monad. Let's see if we can take a list, change types to functors, and get a free monad.

A list is either a `Nil` or a `Cons` of a head and tail. In Scala a list can be defined as:

```scala
sealed trait List[A]
final case class Nil[A]() extends List[A]
final case class Cons[A](head: A, tail: List[A]) extends List[A]
```

Here's how we change types to functors in the definition of `List` to get a free monad:
- We turn `Nil` to "no functor application", i.e., a raw type `A`.
- In `Cons[A](head: A, tail: List[A])`, we turn `head: A` to a single functor application, e.g., `F[_]`
- For `tail: List[A]`, since the type is `List[A]` itself, we turn it to the free monad type.

Putting these together, here's what we get:

```scala
sealed trait Free[F[_], A]
final case class Nil[F[_], A](a: A) extends Free[F, A]
final case class Cons[F[_], A](ffa: F[Free[F, A]]) extends Free[F, A]
```

This is exactly the free monad. Following conventions, we use `Return` and `Bind` instead of `Nil` and `Cons`, hence

```scala
sealed trait Free[F[_], A]
final case class Return[F[_], A](a: A) extends Free[F, A]
final case class Bind[F[_], A](ffa: F[Free[F, A]]) extends Free[F, A]
```

In practice, though, people usually use the following slightly different definition of free monad, with three case classes:

```scala
sealed trait Free[F[_], A]
final case class Return[F[_], A](a: A) extends Free[F, A]
final case class Suspend[F[_], A](s: F[A]) extends Free[F, A]
final case class FlatMap[F[_], A, B](s: Free[F, A], f: A => Free[F, B]) extends Free[F, B]
```

The advantage of this definition is that it is a monad for any type constructor `F`, while in the previous definition, `Free[F, A]` is a monad only if `F` is a functor. But for the purpose of this post, we'll stick to the simpler definition with two case classes, `Return` and `Bind`.

## Lossless Join

As mentioned before, the `join` operation on a monad is comparable to the `combine` operator on a monoid. So, let's draw the analogy again between free monads and free monoids in order to understand how `join` works for free monads. In a free monoid `(List[A], ++, Nil)`, the `combine` operator (`++`) concatenates two `List[A]`s into a longer `List[A]`. Analogously, in a free monad `Free[F, A]`, we would expect that the `join` operation should take two applications of functor `F`, namely `Free[F, Free[F, A]]`, and merge them into a single "larger" application of functor `F` in a way that does not lose any information unnecessarily.

Unlike the free monoid case, the above sentence can be hard to understand without some visualization, so let's do that. First, let's take a look at the definition of `join` for `Free[F, A]`:

```scala
import cats.Functor
import cats.implicits._

def join[F[_] : Functor, A]: Free[F, Free[F, A]] => Free[F, A] = {
  case Return(fa) => fa
  case Bind(ffa) => Bind(ffa map join)
}
```

To see how this works, let's first take a closer look at what `Free[F, Free[F, A]]` and `Free[F, A]` are.

- A `Free[F, Free[F, A]]` is either a `Return` that contains a single `Free[F, A]`, or a `Bind` containing an `F[Free[F, Free[F, A]]]`, which is a container of `Free[F, Free[F, A]]`s. So, `Free[F, Free[F, A]]` can be thought of as a tree where each node is a `Free[F, Free[F, A]]`. A node is an internal node if it is a container (inside a `Bind`), `F[Free[F, Free[F, A]]]`. For each internal nodes, its children are the `Free[F, Free[F, A]]`s contained in the container. A node is a leaf node if it is a `Free[F, A]` (inside a `Return`). If each `F` contains a single `Free[F, Free[F, A]]`, then the tree degenerates into a list.
- Similarly, a `Free[F, A]` is also a tree: each internal node is a container `F[Free[F, A]]`, and each leaf node is an `A`.

Let's call the tree of a `Free[F, Free[F, A]]` a "big tree", and that of a `Free[F, A]` a "small tree". A big tree is thus a tree where internal nodes are containers inside `Bind`, and leaf nodes are small trees inside `Return`. A small tree is a tree where internal nodes are containers inside `Bind`, and leaf nodes are values of `A` inside `Return`.

The following graph shows a big tree:

<img src="/assets/images/bigtree.png" width='400'>
<center>Fig 1. A big tree representing a Free[F, Free[F, A]]</center>

If we take the three small trees in Fig 1. out of the `Return`s and expand them, we may get the following tree:

<img src="/assets/images/smalltree.png" width='579'>
<center>Fig 2. A small tree representing a Free[F, A]</center>

As you can see, it is a small tree representing a `Free[F, A]`, and it contains the same information as the big tree in Fig 1. No information loss. This is exactly what `join` does when applied to a big tree: it takes the small trees in the leaf nodes of the big tree out of the `Return`s and expands them, resulting in a small tree.

Free monads are widely used to encode a computation involving multiple steps as a pure value. Since the `join` operation of free monads are lossless (barring the necessary loss as required by monad laws), all information of the computation is preserved in a recursive structure similar as the one shown in Fig 2. This structure can be interpreted in different ways by different interpreters at a later stage.

## Universal Construction

There is a universal construction for free monads which is similar to the one for free monoids, which can be described in the following way (you can read it side-by-side with the universal construction for free monoids to see the analogy): a free monad for a functor `F`, denoted as `FreeMonad`<sub>`F`</sub>, is a monad such that, given any other monad `G` and any [natural transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation) `α` from `F` to `G`, `α` uniquely identifies a monad homomorphism from `FreeMonad`<sub>`F`</sub> to `G`, and vice versa. In other words, given any other monad `G`, there is a 1-1 mapping between natural transformations from `F` to `G` and monad homomorphisms from `FreeMonad`<sub>`F`</sub> to `G`.


In fact, the universal constructions for both free monoids and free monads are special cases of the universal construction for [free objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_object).

# Cofree Comonads

Since we've come this far, I'd like to briefly mention cofree comonads here. With the understanding of free monoids and free monads, it shouldn't take a ton of work to explain cofree comonads.

In category theory and functional programming, a "co-something" is the dual of "something", and it generally implies reversing the arrows, and turning sum types (i.e., either `A` or `B`) into product types (i.e., both `A` and `B`) and vice versa.

A ___comonad___ is obtained by reversing the arrows in `pure` and `join` in a monad:

```scala
trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
  def pure[A](a: A): F[A]
  def join[A](ffa: F[F[A]]): F[A]
}

trait Comonad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
  def extract[A](x: F[A]): A           // Dual of "pure"
  def duplicate[A](fa: F[A]): F[F[A]]  // Dual of "join"
}
```

A ___cofree comonad___ for a functor `F` is defined as:

```scala
final case class Cofree[F[_], A](head: A, tail: F[Cofree[F, A]])
```

While `Free[F, A]` is a sum type (it is either an `A` or an `F[Free[F, A]]`), `Cofree[F, A]` is a product type (it contains both an `A` and an `F[Cofree[F, A]]`).

The ___universal construction for cofree comonads___ is similar to the one for free monads, but with the arrows reversed: a cofree comonad for a functor `F`, denoted as `CofreeComonad`<sub>`F`</sub>, is a comonad such that, given any other comonad `G`, there is a 1-1 mapping between natural transformations from `G` to `F` and comonad homomorphisms from `G` to `CofreeComonad`<sub>`F`</sub>.
